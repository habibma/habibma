📊 **42 Progress & Stats**

I care about understanding how things work under the hood — not just making them work.

🧠 **How I Think**

I see myself as a problem solver.

When I notice a gap, I build something to close it.
When something is unclear, I dig until I understand it deeply.

I enjoy:

- Breaking down complex problems
- Designing structured solutions
- Building tools that are actually useful

---

🤝 **Collaboration**

I’m open to collaborating on meaningful projects — especially those that:

- Solve real-world problems
- Improve user experience
- Teach me something new
- Are built by passionate and supportive teams
